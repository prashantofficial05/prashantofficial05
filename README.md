# Prashant Raut - Data Analyst/ Data Scientist Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Prashant !  I am on track to completing my degree in Artificial Intelligence And Data Science (B.E. AI & Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in the Data science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data Analyst/ data scientist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in Python,SQL,data analyst, statistical analysis and Machine Learning which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data Analyst/ data scientist.

In my free time, I enjoy problem solving skills and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
